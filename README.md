# Implementing an interactive dance ability for the robot Mini Maggie

This was my bachelor's thesis project. I worked at the RoboticsLab of my university (Carlos III in Madrid) to implement a new social ability to the robots, which in my case was a dance ability. I've uploaded the memory of the project in case anyone wants to know the details of what I implemented! :)
